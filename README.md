# usb-dev-board
Development/testing board for various types of USB port. Pin headers to allow ports to be connected to eachother or to the on-board ATMega8u2 microcontroller with USB capability. The headers can also be useful to "sniff" signals going over USB between 2 devices, either using a scope, or passively using the onboard microcontroller!
